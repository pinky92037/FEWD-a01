### Inspiration
My recent trip to Barcelona inspired me in many different aspects of my design. One of biggest inspiration was the work of Antoni Gaudi. I was supprised that his work was extremely artistic yet very functional. I learned that I should always carefully consider both fuctionality and aesthetics to produce beautiful web site. My favorite work of his was the Sagrada Familia and is supposed to be finished in 2026.
